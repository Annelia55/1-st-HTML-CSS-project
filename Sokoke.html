                <h1>Sokoke</h1>
                <p>This exotic cat originates from the Sokoke district of eastern Kenya, but was further developed in Denmark. Its unusual coat pattern, which displays a “wood grain” effect, is a crowd-pleaser at cat shows, and its friendly nature is perfect for those seeking an animal companion.</p>
                <p><b>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</b></p>
                <p>The Sokoke Forest Cat has a wild look. A medium-sized cat, its body is graceful and slim but muscular. The rear legs are higher than the forelegs and its tail is pointed and tapered. The Sokoke Forest Cat also has a relatively small head with almond-shaped eyes that are usually amber to light green in color.
                    The most eye-catching feature of the Sokoke Forest Cat, however, is its unusual coat, which is lustrous, short, and body-hugging. The coat pattern, dubbed “African Tabby,” resembles the Blotched Tabby with a “wood grain” look. The color of the coat ranges from warm light brown to deep chestnut brown.</p>
