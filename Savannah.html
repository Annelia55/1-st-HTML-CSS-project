                    <h3><b>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</b></h3>
                    <p class="text">The Savannah is an unusual, exotic breed of domestic cat that looks much like its ancestor, the African Serval, but is smaller in size. One of the features that make this breed so unique is its strikingly bold and spotted coat, which can vary from brown, tan or gold with black or dark brown spots; silver with black or dark grey spots; black with black spots; and black tipped silver with black spots.
                        The Savannah’s fur can also have the classic marble pattern, snow coloration, and other diluted colors. Their overall look depends greatly on generational breeding and genetic dilution.
                        <br>The Savannah has a lean muscular build, a short, thick tail, a long neck and long legs. These features give the feline a tall appearance, but it is actually medium sized and tends to weigh less than other similarly sized domestic cats. One of its other most striking features is the shape of its hooded eyes, which are flat on top, and its large, tall ears that are situated right at the top of its head.</p>
                    <h3><b>PERSONALITY AND TEMPERAMENT</b></h3>
                    <p class="text">This very active cat is curious, assertive, and an adventure-seeker. It requires a lot of interaction and attention on a daily basis, either with its companion human(s) or other companion cats. This cat is also very loyal, and will develop a strong bond with people.
                        The Savannah is not a lap cat, but will show affection to its human family by following them around the house and giving them frequent head butts. They love to play in water, and are easily trained to walk on a leash with a harness. They also love to play active games such as fetch. Because of these traits, Savannahs are thought to have "dog-like" personalities.</p>
                    <h3><b>CARE</b></h3>
                    <p class="text">Brush a Savannah’s short to medium-length coat once or twice a week to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing.
                        <br>It’s a good idea to provide a Savannah with a large outdoor enclosure or to keep her as an indoor-only cat to prevent diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors (such as being hit by a car). Savannahs who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have a unique and beautiful cat without paying for it.
                        <br>Be aware some cities or states have laws against keeping hybrid or exotic animals. While the cats registered with TICA are considered fully domestic, a first- or second-generation Savannah (meaning one who has a serval as a parent or grandparent) may face restrictions. Check the laws in your area before purchasing any Savannah that could fall under laws governing hybrids. Check the Hybrid Law for more information.</p>
                    <h3><b>HEALTH</b></h3>
                    <p class="text">Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. The Savannah is generally healthy, however, and does not have any known genetic problems. Cosmetic flaws may keep some Savannahs out of the show ring, but they don’t affect his health or his ability to be a great companion.</p>
                    <h3><b>HISTORY AND BACKGROUND</b></h3>
                    <p class="text">The first documented Savannah cat was born in April 1986, when Bengal cat breeder Judee Frank paired her eight-pound female Siamese Sealpoint cat with Ernie, a thirty-pound male Serval cat belonging to Suzy Wood. Neither one expected the unusually beautiful and graceful offspring that resulted, which Suzy took home with her. The kitten was christened "Savannah," after the African grasslands that are home to the Serval’s ancestors. This kitten became the first F1 (first generation hybrid cross).
                        With Savannah, Suzy was able to breed the first known F2 (second generation) Savannah cat. The feline’s unique physical traits and dynamic personality attracted the attention and interest of Patrick Kelly, who then obtained one of the kittens. Patrick Kelly wanted to produce a new breed of domestic cat, and enlisted the aid of cat breeder Joyce Sroufe to assist him.
                        By painstakingly researching the steps needed to create a feline breed that would be recognized by the national cat registry, Patrick Kelly and Joyce Sroufe were able to successfully produce a new feline breed. Together, Kelly and Sroufe are credited with writing and presenting the Savannah breed standard to The International Cat Association (TICA) in 1996. Kelly and Sroufe were successful, and as of 2001, the Savannah cat has been recognized as a New Advanced Breed Class. </p>
