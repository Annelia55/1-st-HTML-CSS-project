                <p>The Egyptian Mau fascinates many cat lovers, not only because of its rich history - which began in ancient Egypt - but because of its good nature and unique appearance.</p>

                        <h3><b>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</b></h3>
                        <p>This long, graceful cat really stands out in a crowd due to its unique spots and markings. These spots come in a variety of shapes, be they round or oblong, and differ from cat to cat. The Egyptian Mau's face, meanwhile, is adorned with an M-shaped mark on the forehead and two black streaking lines across its cheeks.
                            Additionally, the cat's gleaming coat, which is soft and silky, is covered with smoke-colored hair, and its eyes are almond-shaped and gooseberry-green.</p>
                        <h3><b>PERSONALITY AND TEMPERAMENT</b></h3>
                        <p>Beauty may inspire love at first sight but good nature nurtures it. The same goes for the Egyptian Mau. It may originally be acquired for its beautiful coat, but it is valued and loved for its good temperament and helpfulness.
                            It follows orders and is very good at fetching things -- perhaps a vestige of its ancestors, who retrieved game shot by their owners. Hunting is also an inherited attribute: Egyptian Maus love to play hunting games indoors and if given a free hand they would hunt outdoors.
                            Although it is extremely loyal to its human family, many are initially wary with strangers. The Mau also has a melodious voice, which it uses to communicate distress or hunger to its owners. The Mau may even wag its tail or tread its feet to further illustrate its displeasure.</p>
                        <h3><b>CARE</b></h3>
                        <p>The Egyptian Mau’s coat is easily cared for with weekly combing to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. A bath is rarely necessary.
                            Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Trim the nails every couple of weeks. Wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don’t run the risk of spreading any infection. Check the ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear.
                            Keep the litter box spotlessly clean. Cats are very particular about bathroom hygiene, and a dirty box may cause them to start using other places in the house instead.
                            It’s a good idea to keep an Egyptian Mau as an indoor-only cat to protect him from diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car. Keeping him indoors also protects local birds and wildlife from this avid hunter. Egyptian Maus who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such a beautiful cat without paying for it.</p>
                        <h3><b>HEALTH</b></h3>
                        <p>Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Egyptian Maus are generally healthy, but be sure to ask a breeder about the incidence of health problems in her lines and what testing has been done for any that are genetic in nature.</p>
                        <h3><b>HISTORY AND BACKGROUND</b></h3>
                        <p>The Mau (which is the Egyptian word for cat) is one of the oldest cat breeds in the world; its forefathers were even part of religion, mythology, and everyday life in ancient Egypt. It was also depicted in ancient Egyptian art, such as sculptures and paintings, including a papyrus painting (circa 1100 B.C.) depicting Ra in the form of a spotted cat cutting the head off Apep, an evil serpent.
                            <br><br>Another painting, dated 1400 B.C., portrays a spotted cat bringing back a duck for an Egyptian hunter. This evidence shows that not only were cats revered in ancient Egypt but that they had proved their usefulness to man.
                            It wasn't until the 20th century that Europeans began to take a keen interest in the breed. However, just when cat breeders in France, Italy, and Switzerland began to devote their energy to developing the breed, World War II began. Like many other cat breeds, few Maus survived the war.
                            Its history in North America began with the importation of a few Maus in 1956 by exiled Russian princess Nathalie Troubetskoy. She visited Italy and collected some Mau survivors and even imported a Mau from Egypt.
                            <br><br>The Mau soon caught the eye of cat lovers who wanted to preserve this unique and ancient breed. But because of the small gene pool, a certain amount of cross-breeding became inevitable.
                            In the 1980s, breeder Cathie Rowan brought 13 additional Maus from Egypt into the United States, paving the way for more imports.
                            The Mau was recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Federation in 1969. It was given Championship status in 1977 by the Cat Fanciers' Association, and now has the status in all associations.</p>
