                <figcaption><h4>Sokoke</h4> <br>
                This exotic cat originates from the Sokoke district of eastern Kenya, but was further developed in Denmark. Its unusual coat pattern, which displays a “wood grain” effect, is a crowd-pleaser at cat shows, and its friendly nature is perfect for those seeking an animal companion...

                An eye-catching breed that is still in its infancy, the Devon Rex will make its home in your arms and in your heart. Just independent enough to be an ideal cat for working families, the Devon will shower its people with love and attention when they are around, and stay out of trouble when they are not...

                The Egyptian Mau fascinates many cat lovers, not only because of its rich history - which began in ancient Egypt - but because of its good nature and unique appearance. This long, graceful cat really stands out in a crowd due to its unique spots and markings...

                    One of the oldest and naturally purest breeds found today is the Korat. The original descent is not known, nor is it known when this breed broke from the jungle to make its place with humans. The standards for the Korat, however, are strict...

                The Savannah is an unusual, exotic breed of domestic cat that looks much like its ancestor, the African Serval, but is smaller in size. One of the features that make this breed so unique is its strikingly bold and spotted coat, which can vary from brown...

                    Its body shape and double coat are what makes this cat so unique. This dense and long-flowing hair provides excellent protection in the winter (and makes it a soft cuddling partner). The Norwegian Forest Cat's well-balanced body structure...

                    The Singapura is a tiny cat with large eyes and ears. It is sized from small to medium, with the male Singapura weighing in at about six to eight pounds, and the female at a mere five pounds. The hair color standard for the Singapura is sepia agouti ticking...

                    This is a medium- to large-sized cat, muscular and heavy for its appearance and size. Its ears are large to very large, open wide and upright, much like the ears of a bat. The eyes are set wide and are round with a slight slant at the upper corners - lemon shaped, by most accounts...

                <figcaption><h4>Tonkinese</h4> <br>
                The Tonkinese is a human designed breed, the result of a crossing of Siamese and Burmese breeds. It is medium in size, solid, and very muscular, but the conformation of a Tonkinese calls for balance and moderation rather than any specific size or characteristic...

                The Turkish Angora is a naturally occurring breed from the "old country," with traces of its line going back several millennia. Medium in size with a long, svelte, well-balanced body, it is the very picture of grace. Long is the adjective that best typifies this cat breed...
